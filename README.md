It takes bets in form of NFTs on polygon chain and uses Polygon ID to verify the age,so the code is on polygon chain it first sees if the user has an nft of the same value as the bet if not it connects them to one of the most trusted nft marketplace for polygon but before all of that it tells them how and why to buy nfts and how we can use nfts to place as bets if the user has the nft of same value as the bet ,now the key function here is that they dont have to specifically buy a nft of certain amount they could just put their nft and then if somebody has the nft of the same value will play a game with them there are three sets of game and the player who has challenged will have to wait to be accepted by the one who has been challenged or they dont have to go through this whole process if they have nfts of some set value margin there they would get matched with another person of the same bet margin value, and in all of this bet is strictly prohibited to nfts with still values not the fluctualting ones and by fluctuation i mean in hours, not in days,now in a ideal game after the other person has accepted  the challenge, two players would play the game they chose and the winner would be given the all of the bets in the assigned match and the loser goes home empty handed,and before all of this it uses polygon ID to verify you are 18+
